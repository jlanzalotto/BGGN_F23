## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

Every functioni in R has at least 3 things:
-name (you pick it)
-arguments (the inputs(s) to your function), and 
-the body
```{r}
# Example input vectors to start with
student1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)

mean(student1)

min(student1)
max(student1)

which.min(student1) # which of the values is the minimum
student1[-8]
```

```{r}
#Q1: function to determine this
grade <- function(x){
  x[is.na(x)] <-0
  mean(x[-which.min(x)])
}
grade(student2)
```
QUESTION 2
```{r}
#Q2
data <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput",
                 row.names=1)
# for each row in data, apply grade function
answer2<- apply(data,1,grade)
which.max(answer2)
```
 

QUESTION 3
```{r}
hw_avg <-apply(data,2,mean,na.rm=TRUE)
which.min(hw_avg)

```
```{r}
mask <- data
mask[is.na(mask)] <-0
which.min(apply(mask,2,mean))

```

```{r}



apply(mask,2,cor,y=answer2)
#homework 5!

```
